## Hi, I’m Konstant. 

I run a small business called Konstant’s Pedal Supply, where I sell affordable guitar gear to musicians all across South Africa. 

I’m an artist by day and an entrepreneur by night, combining creativity with a passion for great music. 

Whether you’re looking to build your first pedalboard or add something new to your sound, I’m here to help
with quality gear that won’t break the bank. 

Every item is handpicked, tested, and shipped with care. I also assist with custom pedalboard setups and can help source gear and instruments, if you’re after something specific. 

Let’s build your tone together, affordably, locally, and versatile.
