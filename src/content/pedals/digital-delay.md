# Vintage Overdrive Pro

This pedal delivers the classic mid-focused overdrive sound that has defined rock music for decades. With its simple three-knob interface (Drive, Tone, Level), you can easily dial in everything from subtle boost to heavy saturation.

## Features
- True bypass switching
- High-quality components
- Hand-wired in the USA
- Standard 9V DC power operation

Perfect for guitarists looking to add warmth and character to their clean amp tone or push an already overdriven amp into singing sustain.
