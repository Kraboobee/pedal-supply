The Sonicake WolWah is a compact, budget-friendly auto-wah pedal that reacts to your picking dynamics for that classic quack and sweep. It features selectable modes between volume and Wah, so you can easily switch between the two. Whether youâ€™re laying down funky rhythms, expressive leads, or experimental textures, the WolWah delivers responsive, vocal-like tones that bring your guitar or bass to life.
